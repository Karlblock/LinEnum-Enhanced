# RFC Template

- **RFC Number**: XXXX (assigned by maintainers)
- **Title**: [Your RFC Title]
- **Author(s)**: [Your Name] <your.email@example.com>
- **Status**: Draft
- **Type**: Feature | Enhancement | Process | Breaking Change
- **Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary

*One paragraph explanation of the feature/change. This should be a clear, concise description that someone unfamiliar with the project can understand.*

## Motivation

*Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?*

*Please provide concrete examples and user stories where possible. What problems are we trying to solve?*

### User Stories

*Format: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."*

- As a penetration tester, I want modular plugins so that I can customize enumeration for specific environments
- As a security analyst, I want JSON output so that I can integrate LinEnum with my SIEM platform

## Detailed Design

*This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the project to understand and implement.*

### Architecture Overview

*High-level architectural changes*

### API Design

*If this RFC introduces new APIs or changes existing ones, specify them here*

```bash
# Example command syntax
./LinEnum.sh --plugin network --output json --config custom.conf
```

### Data Structures

*New data structures, formats, or schemas*

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "scan_id": "uuid-here",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-19T10:30:00Z",
  "results": {
    "system": { ... },
    "network": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Implementation Plan

*Break down the implementation into phases*

1. **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure changes
2. **Phase 2**: Plugin system implementation
3. **Phase 3**: Documentation and examples

### Error Handling

*How will errors be handled? What happens when things go wrong?*

### Security Considerations

*What are the security implications of this change? How do we ensure it doesn't introduce vulnerabilities?*

### Performance Impact

*What is the expected performance impact? Include benchmarks if available.*

### Backward Compatibility

*Is this a breaking change? How will existing users be affected?*

## Drawbacks

*Why should we NOT do this? What are the costs/downsides?*

- Implementation complexity
- Maintenance burden
- Potential for bugs
- User confusion

## Alternatives

*What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?*

### Alternative 1: [Name]
*Description and pros/cons*

### Alternative 2: [Name]
*Description and pros/cons*

### Do Nothing
*What happens if we don't implement this?*

## Prior Art

*Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.*

- How do other tools solve this problem?
- What lessons can we learn from similar implementations?
- Papers, blog posts, or other resources that influenced this design

## Unresolved Questions

*What parts of the design do we expect to resolve through the RFC process?*

- How should we handle edge case X?
- What should the default behavior be for Y?
- Should we include feature Z in the initial implementation?

## Future Possibilities

*Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect the project as a whole.*

- How might this feature evolve in the future?
- What additional features would this enable?
- How does this fit into the broader roadmap?
